# Julia Practices
This repository contains my Julia solutions of problems from some coding practice sites such as HackerRank and Codewars. I am a scientist/engineer who has been using Python for data processing quite a bit, and Julia seems to take an interesting approach, which I decided to try. 

I jut started learning Julia programming language, so solutions here are definitely not following the best practice. Solutions will change over time definitely.

The licenses of the problems here follow the original licenses, and I do not own any rights of them. The license of the solutions here follow the MIT license.
